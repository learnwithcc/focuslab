# NOTE: Removed KV_REST_API_URL and KV_REST_API_TOKEN - Using unified Upstash Redis for all caching
```

### Known Issues (Non-Blocking)
```
1. TypeScript: 44 type errors (unused variables, type mismatches)
   - Impact: Development experience, not runtime
   - Priority: Medium (cleanup recommended)

2. ESLint: 111 linting issues (accessibility, code quality)
   - Impact: Code quality, accessibility warnings
   - Priority: Medium (gradual improvement recommended)

3. Test Failures: 2/19 tests failing
   - contact.test.tsx: Router context issue
   - index.test.tsx: Newsletter form text matcher issue
   - Impact: Testing coverage, not functionality
   - Priority: Low (tests need Router mock setup)

4. External Module Warnings: Node.js modules externalized for browser
   - Impact: None (expected behavior for serverless)
   - Priority: Low (informational only)
