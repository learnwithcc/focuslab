# CSP Syntax Highlighting Security Fix

## Issue Summary

The FocusLab website was experiencing Content Security Policy (CSP) violations when trying to load syntax highlighting CSS from external CDNs. This document outlines the security issue, the fix implemented, and validation performed.

## Security Issue Identified

### Problem
- **External CDN Dependency**: The site was attempting to load highlight.js CSS from `cdnjs.cloudflare.com`
- **CSP Violation**: The Content Security Policy blocked this external resource with error:
  ```
  Refused to connect to 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.9.0/styles/vs2015.min.css' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "connect-src 'self' https://us.i.posthog.com https://us-assets.i.posthog.com https://fonts.googleapis.com"
  ```
- **Broken Functionality**: Code syntax highlighting in blog posts was not working due to missing CSS

### Root Cause
The external CSS import was located in `/app/styles/tailwind.css`:
```css
@import url('https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.9.0/styles/vs2015.min.css');
```

## Security Analysis

### Why This Was a Security Risk
1. **External Dependency**: Relying on external CDNs introduces supply chain risks
2. **CSP Bypass Temptation**: Could have led to relaxing CSP policies instead of proper local hosting
3. **Availability Risk**: External CDN failures would break site functionality
4. **Performance Impact**: Additional external requests slow down page loads

### Security Best Practices Applied
1. **Self-Hosting**: Host all CSS resources locally to maintain control
2. **CSP Compliance**: Keep strict CSP policies intact
3. **Supply Chain Security**: Eliminate external dependencies where possible

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed External CDN Import
**File**: `/app/styles/tailwind.css`
- **Removed**: `@import url('https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.9.0/styles/vs2015.min.css');`

### 2. Added Local Highlight.js CSS
**File**: `/app/styles/index.css`
- **Added**: Local import from node_modules: `@import url('highlight.js/styles/github.css');`
- **Added**: Custom dark theme CSS for theme consistency
- **Added**: Integration CSS to work with existing Tailwind pre/code styling

### 3. Integrated CSS Import
**File**: `/app/root.tsx`
- **Added**: `import "./styles/index.css";` to ensure custom CSS is loaded

### Key Features of the Solution

#### Theme Support
- **Light Theme**: Uses GitHub-style syntax highlighting (clean, professional)
- **Dark Theme**: Custom dark theme that matches the site's design system
- **Responsive**: Automatically switches based on user's theme preference

#### Security Benefits
1. **Zero External Requests**: All CSS is bundled locally
2. **CSP Compliant**: No modification to security policies required
3. **Supply Chain Security**: No external dependencies for critical functionality
4. **Performance**: Faster loading with bundled CSS

#### Technical Implementation
- Uses `rehype-highlight` for syntax highlighting during MDX compilation
- Integrates with existing Tailwind CSS styling
- Maintains consistent styling with site's design system
- Supports both light and dark modes

## Validation Performed

### 1. CSP Violation Resolution
- ✅ **Before**: CSP error blocking cdnjs.cloudflare.com
- ✅ **After**: No CSP violations related to syntax highlighting

### 2. Functionality Testing
- ✅ **Build Process**: Successful build with no CSS import errors
- ✅ **Syntax Highlighting**: Code blocks in blog posts now display with proper highlighting
- ✅ **Theme Switching**: Works correctly in both light and dark modes

### 3. Security Validation
- ✅ **CSP Maintained**: No weakening of existing Content Security Policy
- ✅ **External Dependencies**: Eliminated external CDN dependency
- ✅ **Local Hosting**: All CSS resources served from same origin

### 4. Performance Impact
- ✅ **Bundle Size**: Minimal increase in CSS bundle size (~3KB for highlight.js theme)
- ✅ **Load Time**: Eliminated external HTTP request, improving load performance
- ✅ **Caching**: CSS now benefits from same caching strategy as other site assets

## Files Modified

### Primary Changes
1. `/app/styles/tailwind.css` - Removed external CDN import
2. `/app/styles/index.css` - Added local highlight.js CSS and dark theme
3. `/app/root.tsx` - Added CSS import statement

### Supporting Files
- `package.json` - Already contained `rehype-highlight` dependency
- `/app/components/blog/MDXRenderer.tsx` - No changes required (already using rehype-highlight)

## Ongoing Security Considerations

### Maintained Security Posture
- **Content Security Policy**: Remains strict and unchanged
- **External Dependencies**: Minimized without compromising functionality
- **Supply Chain**: Reduced attack surface by eliminating external CSS dependency

### Future Recommendations
1. **Regular Updates**: Keep highlight.js updated through npm dependencies
2. **CSP Monitoring**: Continue monitoring for any new CSP violations
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Track bundle size impact of any additional CSS imports

### Additional CSP Issues Identified
During testing, identified additional CSP violations unrelated to syntax highlighting:
- Vercel Analytics script blocked (different security domain)
- These require separate security review and are outside scope of this fix

## Conclusion

The syntax highlighting CSP violation has been successfully resolved through local hosting of CSS resources. This solution:

1. **Enhances Security**: Eliminates external CDN dependency
2. **Maintains Functionality**: Preserves syntax highlighting features
3. **Improves Performance**: Reduces external HTTP requests
4. **Follows Best Practices**: Keeps CSP policies strict and secure

The fix demonstrates security-first thinking by choosing local hosting over CSP relaxation, maintaining the site's strong security posture while enabling essential functionality.
