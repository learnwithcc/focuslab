# Images Directory

This directory contains static image assets for the application.

## Organization

- Place all static images here
- Use descriptive filenames
- Consider using subdirectories for organization (e.g., `icons/`, `backgrounds/`, `logos/`)
- Optimize images for web use

## Usage

Images in this directory can be accessed directly via public URLs:

```tsx
<img src="/images/logo.png" alt="Logo" />
```

## Optimization

Consider using image optimization tools or services for production:
- WebP/AVIF formats for better compression
- Multiple sizes for responsive images
- CDN integration for better performance
