# Change vite starting port to 3600 (2025-06-28 21:07Z)

_**User**_

Let's set vite to run on a different starting port in this project. I'm doing some parallel development on another project and have run into some issues with launching sessions because the address was in use. Let's try setting it to start at 3600.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants to change the Vite development server to start on port 3600 instead of the default port. This is a common need when running multiple projects in parallel.

I need to look at the current Vite configuration to see how to modify it. Let me check the vite.config.ts file first to understand the current setup.</details></think>

I'll help you configure Vite to run on port 3600. Let me first check the current Vite configuration to see how it's set up.

---

Read file: vite.config.ts

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I can see the current Vite configuration already has a server section with the port set to 3000 on line 52-54:

```typescript
server: {
  port: 3000,
},
```

I just need to change this from 3000 to 3600 as requested by the user.</details></think>

Perfect! I can see the current Vite configuration already has a server section with the port set to 3000. I'll update it to use port 3600 as you requested.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Great! I've successfully updated the Vite configuration to use port 3600. The user should now be able to run their development server on this port without conflicts with their other project.

I should also let them know that they might want to update any documentation or README files that reference the port, and that they can also override this with an environment variable or command line flag if needed.</details></think>

Perfect! I've updated your Vite configuration to use port 3600 instead of 3000. Now when you run your development server with `npm run dev` or `pnpm dev`, it will start on port 3600.

Your application will now be available at `http://localhost:3600` instead of the default port.

A few additional notes:
- If you need to temporarily use a different port, you can override this with the `--port` flag: `pnpm dev --port 3601`
- You might want to update any documentation or README files that reference the port number
- If you have any scripts or tools that reference `localhost:3000`, you'll need to update those to use `localhost:3600`

The change is minimal and should work seamlessly with your existing setup. You can now run your parallel development projects without port conflicts! [[memory:186166]]
