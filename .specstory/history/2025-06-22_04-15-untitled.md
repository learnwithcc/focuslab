I believe we have completed task 7.5, but it is still marked as pending. If there's anything left to complete, please complete it and mark the parent task as complete as well. 

When 7 is marked done, commence Task 8. There is no need to stop after each subtask. You can continue until you either complete all sub-tasks, or run into an error that you need my help to resolve. Please git commit after each successful sub-task implementation, immediately following a task being marked as done. Always commit the parent task when all sub-tasks have been successfully implemented.
