# Improve header nav and breadcrumb design (2025-07-03 21:13Z)

_**User**_

We need to improve the header nav and breadcrumb implementation. Currently this separation between both is using up way too much vertical real estate for absolutely zero gain. I've highlighted and provided arrows indicating how I would like to see it restyled. I want you to create a new branch from the current one so we have a backup in case things go sideways while we're working on this critical change.
