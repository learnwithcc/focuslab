# Review uncommitted changes before commit (2025-07-03 16:34Z)

_**User**_

Give me a quick overview of all the changes that have not yet been committed, and let's figure out why there are so many changed files before I commit.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you understand what changes are uncommitted and why there are so many modified files. Let me start by checking the git status and then analyzing the key changes.

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

Now I understand what happened! Let me also check the .cursorignore file to see if that explains some of the files:

## Overview of Uncommitted Changes

Based on my analysis, here's what's happening with your large number of uncommitted changes:

### **Root Cause: AI Assistant Rule Consolidation**
The main reason for so many changed files is that **multiple AI assistant rule directories were deleted** in a previous commit, but the deletions are now showing as "changes not staged for commit." This suggests either:

1. **These directories were restored** after being committed as deleted, OR
2. **The deletion wasn't properly committed** and is still pending

### **Categories of Changes:**

#### **1. Deleted AI Assistant Rule Files (Majority of changes):**
- `.claude/` - Claude AI rules (2 files)
- `.clinerules/` - Cline AI rules (6 files) 
- `.roo/` - Roo AI rules (20+ files)
- `.trae/` - Trae AI rules (4 files)
- `.windsurf/` - Windsurf AI rules (6 files)

These appear to be legacy rule files that were consolidated into the current `.cursor/rules/` system.

#### **2. Core Application Changes:**
- **Configuration:** `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `playwright.config.ts`
- **Components:** `Breadcrumb.tsx`, `Navigation.tsx`, `VanillaThemeToggle.tsx`, forms, etc.
- **Routes:** Multiple route files including API routes and page routes
- **Styles:** `index.css`, `tailwind.css`
- **Utilities:** Image optimization, SSR, security utils

#### **3. New Files (Untracked):**
- **Error Boundaries:** Multiple new error boundary components
- **Reports:** Several testing and validation reports
- **Tests:** New Playwright test files
- **Documentation:** Various markdown reports

### **Recommendation:**

The large number of files is primarily due to the AI rule cleanup. I suggest:

1. **Commit the rule deletions** if they should be removed
2. **Group the functional changes** into logical commits
3. **Add the new files** that should be tracked

Would you like me to help you create a clean commit strategy to organize these changes properly?
