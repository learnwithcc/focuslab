Please commence Task 2. There is no need to stop after each subtask. You can continue until you either complete all sub-tasks, or run into an error that you need my help to resolve. Please git commit after each successful sub-task implementation, immediately following a task being marked as done. Always commit the parent task when all sub-tasks have been successfully implemented.
