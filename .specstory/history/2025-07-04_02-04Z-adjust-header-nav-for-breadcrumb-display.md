# Adjust header nav for breadcrumb display (2025-07-04 02:04Z)

_**User**_

What if we adjust the header nav to expand into "breadcrumb display mode" for secondary nav items? I've made a mockup to show how it could work. We can apply the same sort of action to any of the top level menu items later on if we need to. It keeps everything in one line and easy to navigate at a glance.
