Remind me how we view the storybook app in this project

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking about how to view the Storybook app in this project. Let me look at the project structure to see if there's a Storybook setup.

Looking at the project layout, I can see there's a `stories/` directory with several story files:
- `stories/Button.stories.ts`
- `stories/Header.stories.ts`  
- `stories/Page.stories.ts`
- Various other Storybook-related files

I should check the package.json to see if there are any Storybook-related scripts or dependencies. Let me read the package.json file to see the available scripts.</details></think>

Let me check the package.json to see the available scripts for running Storybook in this project.

Read file: package.json

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I can see from the package.json that there are Storybook scripts configured:

- `"storybook": "storybook dev -p 6006"`
- `"build-storybook": "storybook build"`

There are also Storybook dependencies in the devDependencies section. The project is set up to use Storybook and it will run on port 6006.

The user is asking about how to view the Storybook app, so I should tell them about the script command to run it.

Since the memory indicates that this project uses pnpm as the package manager, I should suggest using pnpm to run the script.</details></think>

Based on the package.json, this project has Storybook configured. To view the Storybook app, you can run:

```bash
pnpm storybook
```

This will start the Storybook development server on **port 6006**. Once it's running, you can access it at:

```
http://localhost:6006
```

The project has several stories already set up in the `stories/` directory:
- Button stories (`Button.stories.ts`)
- Header stories (`Header.stories.ts`) 
- Page stories (`Page.stories.ts`)

You can also build a static version of Storybook using:

```bash
pnpm build-storybook
```

The Storybook setup includes addons for documentation and onboarding, so you should have a nice interface to explore and test your components! [[memory:3584503539442482722]]
