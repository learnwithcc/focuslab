# Addressing UI issues before deployment (2025-06-22 21:27:18)

We've completed the initial set of tasks defined by the PRD! Great work! Now it's time to get to the details.

The nav bar appears duplicated â€” once at the very top and again below. This is likely a hydration or rendering issue, possibly from a layout component being rendered twice. Worth debugging before deployment.
