# Style the theme switcher wrapper (2025-07-03 19:30Z)

_**User**_

Let's work on the styling for the theme switcher. I want you to create a wrapper for it styled to look like our previous implementation of the theme toggle button. It doesn't have to hover like the previous one. It can stay in the navbar. But it does need to have the same animation applied please.
