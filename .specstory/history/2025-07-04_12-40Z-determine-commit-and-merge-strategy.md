# Determine commit and merge strategy (2025-07-04 12:40Z)

_**User**_

I need you to help me figure out our commit and merge strategy here. We're currently in the `feature/optimize-header-breadcrumb` branch, but we have a few different branches, and I believe this optimize one was branched off of header breadcrumb optimization, if I'm not mistaken, which was branched off of post hydration changes. But I need you to confirm that for me before we merge anything, because I think it's time to fold our current features into main, but I want to do it cleanly without introducing any issues. I'm not an expert with GitHub, so I'm counting on your guidance!
