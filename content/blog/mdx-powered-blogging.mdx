# Building a Modern Blog with MDX and Remix

At FocusLab, we believe in using the right tools for the right job. When it came time to build our blog system, we wanted something that would give us the flexibility of React components within our content, while maintaining the simplicity of Markdown for writing.

## Why MDX?

MDX combines the best of both worlds: the simplicity of Markdown for content creation and the power of React components for interactive elements.

```typescript
// Example: Custom component in MDX
import { CalloutBox } from '~/components/blog';

<CalloutBox type="info">
  This is a custom React component embedded directly in our MDX content!
</CalloutBox>
```

## Architecture Overview

Our blog system is built with several key architectural decisions:

### 1. File-Based Content Management

We chose to start with a file-based approach for several reasons:

- **Version Control**: Blog posts are versioned alongside our code
- **Developer Experience**: Writing in familiar markdown syntax
- **Performance**: Static content compilation at build time
- **Simplicity**: No additional backend complexity

### 2. Future-Proof Design

While we're starting with files, our architecture includes a `ContentService` interface that abstracts content fetching:

```typescript
interface ContentService {
  getAllPosts(): Promise<BlogPost[]>;
  getPostBySlug(slug: string): Promise<BlogPost | null>;
  getPostsByCategory(category: string): Promise<BlogPost[]>;
  // ... more methods
}
```

This abstraction allows us to seamlessly migrate to Directus or any other headless CMS in the future without changing our React components.

### 3. Rich Metadata System

Each blog post includes comprehensive frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
description: "SEO-friendly description"
publishedAt: "2025-06-27"
author: "Author Name"
category: "development"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
featured: true
draft: false
---
```

## Key Features

### Syntax Highlighting

Code blocks are automatically highlighted using `rehype-highlight`:

```javascript
// JavaScript example
function calculateReadingTime(content) {
  const wordsPerMinute = 200;
  const words = content.trim().split(/\s+/).length;
  return Math.ceil(words / wordsPerMinute);
}
```

### Reading Time Calculation

We automatically calculate estimated reading time for each post using the `reading-time` package.

### Search and Filtering

Our content service includes powerful search and filtering capabilities:

- Full-text search across titles, descriptions, and content
- Category filtering
- Tag-based filtering
- Featured post highlighting

## Performance Considerations

### Build-Time Compilation

MDX content is compiled at build time, ensuring fast page loads and optimal SEO.

### Caching Strategy

We implement intelligent caching with TTL (Time To Live) for development efficiency while maintaining freshness.

### Code Splitting

Dynamic imports ensure that only necessary code is loaded for each blog page.

## What's Next?

In upcoming posts, we'll dive deeper into:

1. **SEO Optimization**: How we handle meta tags and structured data
2. **Accessibility Features**: Ensuring our blog is accessible to all users
3. **Migration Strategy**: Planning our eventual move to Directus
4. **Performance Metrics**: Measuring and optimizing blog performance

## Conclusion

Building a modern blog system requires balancing current needs with future flexibility. Our MDX-powered approach gives us the best of both worlds: powerful content authoring capabilities today, with a clear path for future enhancements.
