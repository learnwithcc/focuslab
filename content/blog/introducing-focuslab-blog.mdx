# Welcome to the FocusLab Blog! 🧠✨

We're excited to introduce the FocusLab blog, a space dedicated to sharing insights, tutorials, and resources about building neurodivergent-friendly development tools and accessible technology.

## What You'll Find Here

Our blog will cover a wide range of topics that matter to the neurodivergent developer community:

### 🛠️ Tool Development
- Best practices for creating accessible development environments
- Design patterns that reduce cognitive load
- User experience considerations for neurodivergent users

### 🧪 Research & Insights

## Code Example

Here's a simple example of how our tools prioritize clarity:

```typescript
// Clear, self-documenting function names
function createAccessibleButton(options: ButtonOptions): Button {
  return {
    label: options.label,
    onClick: options.action,
    ariaLabel: options.ariaLabel || options.label,
    keyboardNavigable: true,
    highContrast: options.highContrast ?? true
  };
}
```
