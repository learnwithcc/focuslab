This maintains proper HTML semantics and eliminates the structural duplication causing rendering issues.\n</info added on 2025-06-23T01:46:20.484Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-23T02:17:54.941Z>\n**FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATION REQUIRED**\n\nUser reports navigation duplication issue persists despite addressing nested main elements. Previous analysis may have been incomplete or focused on wrong root cause.\n\n**New Investigation Plan:**\n- Use Playwright to capture actual rendered HTML structure in browser\n- Take screenshots of the navigation duplication issue as reported by user\n- Examine DOM tree programmatically to identify all navigation-related elements\n- Check for JavaScript-based navigation rendering that may not be visible in static code analysis\n- Investigate potential hydration issues causing duplicate rendering\n- Test across different routes to see if duplication is route-specific\n- Verify if issue occurs on initial page load vs navigation events\n- Check for any client-side routing logic that might be duplicating navigation elements\n\n**Hypothesis to Test:**\nThe nested main elements fix may have been a red herring. The actual navigation duplication could be caused by:\n1. Client-side JavaScript duplicating navigation after hydration\n2. Route-specific navigation components not identified in initial analysis\n3. CSS or styling issues making single navigation appear duplicated\n4. Browser-specific rendering issues\n5. Conditional rendering logic creating multiple navigation instances\n\nNeed comprehensive browser-based testing to identify the true root cause.\n</info added on 2025-06-23T02:17:54.941Z>",

Currently, all glassmorphic effects likely use the same transition timing from Task 19's implementation. Create a separate CSS class or modify the existing sticky header styles to apply a distinct transition-duration specifically for the box-shadow property. For example, if current glassmorphic effects use transition: all 0.3s ease, modify the dropshadow to use transition: backdrop-filter 0.3s ease, background-color 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.5s ease to create the slower fade effect. Consider using CSS custom properties (--transition-duration-fast: 0.3s, --transition-duration-slow: 0.5s) for maintainable timing values. Ensure the dropshadow effect coordinates well with the scroll-based state management from Task 20's sticky positioning implementation.
